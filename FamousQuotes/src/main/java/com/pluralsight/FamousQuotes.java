/*Create a new Java application named FamousQuotes.
Create an array of strings to store 10 quotes. Add 10 of your favorite quotes to
the array.
Prompt the user to select a number between 1 and 10 and display that quote.
DO NOT use try/catch (yet) to handle the error.
Test the application. Select a number that exists. Does it work?
Enter a number that doesn't exist (any number other than 1 to 10). What
happens?
Now add exception handling to the application and retest.
BONUS: Add a loop to the program asks the user if they want to see another
saying. If they say yes, repeat the process. DO NOT shut the application down
when if an exception occurs. Just pick up with the next iteration.
BONUS: Allow the user to select an option that will display a random quote.
